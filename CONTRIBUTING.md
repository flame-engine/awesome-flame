# Contributing Guide

## General

1. If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit things.
2. Always add your items to the end of a list. The order is first-come-first-serve.

## Articles & Tutorials

You should put your Article/Video/Tutorial in this category if the following conditions are true:

- The Article/Video/Tutorial is about using the Flame Engine.
- The Article/Video/Tutorial needs to have an English version or subtitles. Adding a translation for an existing article is fine.

Entries for that category should look like the following:

`- [My Article](repository url) - By [Name](url)`

If you have a series of articles, you are allowed to bundle them into a sub header:

```
### Tutorial Topic by Name
- [My Article Part 1](url)
- [My Article Part 2](url)
```
